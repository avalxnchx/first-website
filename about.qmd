## About Me

Hi! My name is **Ava Ransbotham** (she/her) and I'm a freshman at Newton South High School. I love to swim, paint, and make pretty graphs :)

## About the Project

The project I've created, *Car Weight and Fuel Efficiency*, shows the relationship between weight and MPG in a variety of cars.

### Goals

-   Create my first website
    +   This requires me to remember to load all the correct packages
-   Determine if there is a correlation between weight and fuel efficiency

"This is data science"
